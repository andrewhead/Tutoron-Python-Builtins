# A Tutoron for Python built-ins

The Python Tutoron detects and explains builtin functions in
Python 2, pulling its documentation from the (Python 2
Docs). It includes non-essential builtins (apply, buffer,
coerce, and intern).

This module is not standalone: It needs to be mounted within
a Tutorons server to use it and even to run the tests.
Follow the instructions at andrewhead/tutorons-base.
